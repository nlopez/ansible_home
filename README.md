# ansible_home
My first foray into [ansible](http://www.ansible.com/) for managing a handful of systems at home.

# Usage
```bash
make # puts you right in a shell ready to run ansible
```

# TODO
* touch `/etc/cloud/cloud-init.disabled` to workaround [cloud-init resetting hostname](https://askubuntu.com/a/1047659)
